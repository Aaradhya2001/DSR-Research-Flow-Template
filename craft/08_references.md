## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Tips
*   **Use a Reference Manager:** Do not manage references manually. Use tools like **Zotero**, **Mendeley**, or **EndNote** from the very beginning of your project.
*   **Choose a Style and Stick to It:** Select the citation style required by your target journal (e.g., IEEE for most engineering publications) and configure your reference manager to use it.
*   **Regularly Clean Your Library:** Ensure the metadata for each entry in your reference manager (author, year, title, journal, DOI) is correct and complete. Garbage in, garbage out.
