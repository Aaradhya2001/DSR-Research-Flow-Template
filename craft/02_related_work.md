# Chapter 2: Related Work

## üéØ Core Goal
To systematically review and critique existing literature, establishing the theoretical foundations for your work and convincingly demonstrating a research gap.

## ‚úÖ Content Checklist (from `module_guidance_paper-structure-v2.md`)
- [ ] **Theoretical Foundations:** Introduce the core theories your work builds upon (e.g., HCI, Game Theory, TAM).
- [ ] **Technical Foundations:** Explain the key technologies relevant to your work (e.g., ERC-4337, ENS).
- [ ] **State-of-the-Art Analysis:** Categorize and critically review existing solutions, highlighting their limitations.
- [ ] **Research Gap Summary:** Conclude the chapter with a strong, clear summary of the identified research gap.

## üîó Logical Flow & Writing Tips
*   **Critique, Don't Just List:** The most common mistake in this chapter is simply listing what others have done. Your goal is to build an argument. For each paper or solution you discuss, answer the question: "How does this relate to my research, and what is its key weakness that my work will address?"
*   **Structure is Key:** Organize the review thematically (e.g., by theory, by technical approach) rather than chronologically. This shows a higher level of synthesis.
*   **Transition to Chapter 3:** The final paragraph should explicitly state the research gap and motivate the need for a new solution, which you will propose in the following chapters. Example: `To address this identified gap, we adopt a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to guide the creation and evaluation of our proposed artifact.`
