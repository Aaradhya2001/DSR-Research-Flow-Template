# Chapter 1: Introduction

## üéØ Core Goal
To capture the reader's interest, clearly establish the problem and its importance, define the research gap, and state the paper's research questions and contributions.

- [ ] **Background:** Start with a broad context and narrow down to the specific research area.
- [ ] **Problem Statement:** Clearly articulate the specific, evidence-backed problem.
- [ ] **Motivation/Significance:** Argue why solving this problem is important.
- [ ] **Gap Analysis:** Briefly mention existing solutions and their common shortcomings.
- [ ] **Research Questions (RQs):** State the core questions the paper will answer.
- [ ] **Artifact Preview:** Briefly introduce your proposed solution/artifact.
- [ ] **Contributions:** List your key contributions (usually three).
- [ ] **Paper Structure:** Outline the rest of the paper.

## üîó Logical Flow & Writing Tips
*   **Structure:** Follow a "funnel" or "inverted pyramid" structure. Start broad (e.g., the importance of Web3), narrow down to the specific problem (e.g., gas payment complexity), identify the gap in current solutions, and then present your specific research question and contributions as the definitive answer.
*   **Transition to Chapter 2:** The end of this chapter should seamlessly lead the reader to expect a deeper dive into what has been done before. A good concluding sentence is: `To situate our contribution, the next section reviews the related work in detail.`
