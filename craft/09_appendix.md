## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Tips
*   **Reference in Text:** Ensure that each appendix is referred to at least once in the main body of the paper (e.g., "For the full statistical output, see Appendix A.").
*   **Label Clearly:** If you have multiple appendices, label them clearly (Appendix A, Appendix B, etc.) with descriptive titles.
*   **Not a Dumping Ground:** Only include material that genuinely adds value for a reader who wants to dig deeper. Do not use it to store content that was cut from the main paper simply because it wasn't good enough.
