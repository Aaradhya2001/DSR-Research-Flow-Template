# Chapter 4: Artifact Design

## üéØ Core Goal
To present the design and implementation of your novel artifact in sufficient detail for an expert to understand its architecture, mechanisms, and novelty.

## ‚úÖ Content Checklist (from `module_guidance_paper-structure-v2.md`)
- [ ] **Design Principles:** State the high-level principles that guided your design choices.
- [ ] **System Architecture:** Provide a clear, global overview of the system using a diagram.
- [ ] **Key Components:** Detail the functionality and interaction of each major component.
- [ ] **Formalized Mechanisms:** For the most novel parts of your design (e.g., a new algorithm, a new protocol), provide a formal or pseudo-formal description (e.g., pseudocode, mathematical model).
- [ ] **Technical Differentiation:** Explicitly summarize how your design is technically different from and superior to existing solutions.

## üîó Logical Flow & Writing Tips
*   **Top-Down Approach:** Start with the high-level architecture to give the reader a map, then zoom into the details of each key component.
*   **Justify Your Decisions:** For every significant design choice, briefly explain *why* you made it. For example, "We chose an on-chain/off-chain hybrid model *in order to* balance decentralization and performance."
*   **Diagrams are Crucial:** This is the most important chapter for high-quality diagrams. Use them to explain architecture, protocols, and data flows.
*   **Transition to Chapter 5:** End the chapter by setting the stage for the evaluation. Example: `Having detailed the design of our artifact, the next chapter will present a comprehensive evaluation to validate its effectiveness against our research objectives.`
