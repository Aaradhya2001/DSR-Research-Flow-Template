### üîó Logical Flow & Writing Tips
*   **Be Self-Contained:** The abstract must be understandable on its own, without the reader needing to consult the main paper.
*   **Be Concise:** Ruthlessly cut every unnecessary word. Most journals have strict word limits (e.g., 150-250 words).
*   **Write it Last:** Write the abstract after the rest of the paper is complete. It's much easier to summarize a finished story.
