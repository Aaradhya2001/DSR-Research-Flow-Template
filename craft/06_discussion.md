# Chapter 6: Discussion

## üéØ Core Goal
To interpret the meaning and significance of your findings, articulate your research contributions, acknowledge limitations, and outline future work. This is where you elevate your results into knowledge.

## ‚úÖ Content Checklist (from `module_guidance_paper-structure-v2.md`)
- [ ] **Interpretation of Findings:** Go beyond the results. *Why* did you get these results? What are the underlying mechanisms?
- [ ] **Theoretical Implications:** How do your findings contribute to academic theory (e.g., extend a model, propose a new design pattern)?
- [ ] **Practical Implications:** What should engineers, designers, or policymakers do differently based on your research?
- [ ] **Limitations:** Honestly and thoroughly discuss the limitations of your study.
- [ ] **Future Work:** Based on the limitations, propose concrete and interesting directions for future research.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Suggested Sentence Starters (Academic Phrasebank)

**To interpret findings:**
*   `The results, particularly the superior performance of our hybrid protocol, can be attributed to the core design principle of decoupling identity from metadata.`
*   `The key insight from our evaluation is that...`

**To state theoretical contributions:**
*   `Our findings contribute to the literature on [...] by proposing and empirically validating the [Your Model/Pattern Name] design pattern.`
*   `This work extends [Existing Theory] by demonstrating its applicability and refinement in the context of decentralized systems.`

**To state practical implications:**
*   `For practitioners, our work provides a concrete blueprint for designing...`
*   `The open-source artifact developed in this study can be directly adopted by...`

**To discuss limitations:**
*   `We must acknowledge several limitations to our study. First, the evaluation was conducted in a simulated testnet environment...`
*   `Second, our model does not account for..., which could be a factor in real-world deployments.`

**To propose future work:**
*   `Based on these limitations, several avenues for future research emerge. A crucial next step is to...`
*   `Future work could also explore the application of our protocol to non-EVM chains.`

## üîó Logical Flow & Writing Tips
*   **The "So What?" Chapter:** If the Evaluation chapter answers "What did you find?", this chapter answers "**So what?**". It's your chance to explain why your work matters.
*   **Connect Everything:** This is the chapter where you connect all the dots: link your results (Chapter 5) back to your research questions (Chapter 1) and the gaps in the literature (Chapter 2), and explain how your design (Chapter 4) led to those results.
*   **Honesty is a Strength:** A well-written, honest limitations section is a sign of academic maturity, not weakness. It shows you have a deep understanding of your own work's boundaries.
*   **Transition to Chapter 7:** The chapter naturally leads to a final summary. Example: `In conclusion, this study has designed and validated a novel protocol... The final chapter will summarize the key takeaways of this research.`
