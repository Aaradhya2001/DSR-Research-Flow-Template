# Chapter 3: Research Methodology

## üéØ Core Goal
To describe and justify the research methodology used in the paper, convincing the reader that the research process is scientific and rigorous.

## ‚úÖ Content Checklist (from `module_guidance_paper-structure-v2.md`)
- [ ] **Methodology Choice:** Clearly state that you are using Design Science Research (DSR).
- [ ] **Framework Citation:** Reference a classic DSR framework (e.g., Hevner et al., 2004; Peffers et al., 2007) to ground your approach.
- [ ] **DSR Process:** Describe how your research maps to the stages of the chosen DSR framework.
- [ ] **Evaluation Method Preview:** Briefly introduce the specific methods you will use to evaluate your artifact (e.g., technical benchmarking, simulation).
- [ ] **Justification:** Explain *why* DSR and your chosen evaluation methods are the most appropriate for answering your research questions.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Suggested Sentence Starters (Academic Phrasebank)

**To state the methodology:**
*   `To address our research questions, this study adopts the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology.`
*   `DSR is highly suitable for this work as our primary goal is to solve a real-world problem through the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel IT artifact.`

**To describe the process:**
*   `Specifically, we follow the six-activity DSR process model proposed by Peffers et al. (2007).`
*   `Our research process began with problem identification (Stage 1), followed by artifact design (Stage 2), and culminated in a rigorous evaluation (Stages 3-5).`

**To justify the evaluation method:**
*   `To evaluate the artifact against our research questions, we employ a quantitative benchmarking approach.`
*   `This method was chosen over alternatives like user studies because our primary research question focuses on the quantifiable trade-offs between performance, cost, and decentralization, for which technical benchmarks provide the most direct and objective evidence.`

## üîó Logical Flow & Writing Tips
*   **Be Concise:** This chapter is usually one of the shortest in a DSR paper. The goal is to be clear and precise, not to write a textbook on DSR.
*   **Focus on Justification:** The most important part is justifying *why* you chose your methods. This demonstrates rigorous thinking to the reviewer.
*   **Transition to Chapter 4:** The chapter should end by logically leading into the detailed description of your artifact. Example: `The following chapter details the design and implementation of the proposed artifact, which was developed following this methodology.`
