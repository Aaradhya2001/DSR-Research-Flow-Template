## 🎯 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive DSR research framework that helps researchers systematically manage the entire process from problem identification to paper writing. Using an innovative "Pipeline + Toolbox + Writing Workshop" model, it makes doctoral research more efficient and organized.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📋 Complete DSR 6-Stage Workflow Template** - Full coverage from problem identification to paper writing
- **📁 Modular Methodology Library** - Reusable research methods and tools
- **✍️ Detailed Chapter Writing Templates** - Specific guidance for each chapter
- **✅ Multi-level Quality Audit Checklists** - Ensure research quality
- **🔄 Clear Collaboration Process** - Best practices for AI-assisted research

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system adopts a three-layer architecture:

### 1. Pipeline Layer
- Core file: `DSR_Workflow_Template.md`
- Function: Main workflow for stage-by-stage research progression
- Contains detailed checklists and collaboration processes for 6 DSR stages

### 2. Toolbox Layer
- Location: `modules/` directory
- Function: Reusable methodology guides and audit checklists
- Includes writing guidance, structural audits, pre-submission checks, etc.

### 3. Writing Workshop Layer
- Location: `craft/` directory
- Function: Chapter-specific writing templates with guidance
- Covers all standard academic paper sections

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhfnetboy/DSR-Research-Flow-Template.git
cd DSR-Research-Flow-Template
```

### 2. Initialize Your Research Project

```bash
# Create your working directory
mkdir -p my-research/writing

# Copy workflow template
cp DSR_Workflow_Template.md my-research/paper1_workflow.md

# Copy writing templates
cp -r craft/* my-research/writing/
```

### 3. Start Your Research

1. Open `paper1_workflow.md` in your editor
2. Follow the 6-stage workflow systematically
3. Answer core questions at each stage
4. Draft corresponding chapters in `writing/`
5. Use `modules/` tools for quality control

## 📖 DSR 6-Stage Workflow

| Stage | Core Activities | Key Questions | Deliverables |
|-------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **1. Problem Identification** | Define research gap and motivation | What specific problem? Why important? | Introduction & Abstract draft |
| **2. Design** | Conceptualize solution | What are design principles? How does it work? | Artifact Design chapter |
| **3. Development** | Build artifact/prototype | How to implement? What technologies? | Methodology chapter |
| **4. Demonstration** | Show feasibility | Does it work? How to prove? | Working prototype/system |
| **5. Evaluation** | Rigorous assessment | How well does it work? What metrics? | Evaluation results & analysis |
| **6. Communication** | Scholarly writing | How to present findings? | Complete paper manuscript |
